# Glitch Locations #

Children of Ur is an informal sequel to <a href="http://www.glitch.com">Glitch</a>, a browser-based MMO created by 
<a href="http://tinyspeck.com">Tiny Speck</a>. This repository contains the
artwork and source code for all of the locations in the game, and will soon contain the art in SVG format to preserve the clarity of vector artwork while removing the restrictions of working with the original Flash files.

The vast majority of these were converted using scripts and have not had human eyes checking for errors. If you find any files that are missing, corrupt, look wrong, or otherwise, feel free to open up an issue in this repo.
